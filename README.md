Byte & Hunger 

This web application is a prototype that seeks to connect restaurants with local food banks and food pantries in an effort to decrease annual food waste in the United States by restaurants. Businesses are able to search for local (Phoenix, AZ) food banks and pantries using an interactive map as well as create tax donation receipts for items donated. In addition, there are informational pages to educate users about annual food waste statistics in the United States.
